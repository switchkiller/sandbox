#DFS - Depth First Search

Everyone loves graph theory. Because of its sweet simplicity and sour complexity.

Today I would love to share my thoughts on DFS.

####Its more like recursive backtracking but clever!

I would not discuss the complete algorithm the boring way. I will go our code way, ahah :)

#####Note: DFS is used for connected components.
