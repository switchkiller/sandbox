Tree is very important and useful data structure. A tree is an connected-acyclic graph. There are many many types of trees.

They are

- Weighted trees
- Rooted trees
- Directed trees
- Tries


Types of Binary Trees are:

1. Full Binary Tree - if node has either 0 or 2 child
2. Complete Binary Tree - if all levels are completely filled except for last level
3. Perfect Binary Tree - if all leaves are at the same level and each node has exactly two children
4. Balanced Binary Tree - if height of the tree is O(logn)
5. Degenerate Tree - Every node has exactly one child
