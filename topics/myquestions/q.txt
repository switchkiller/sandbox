Its 2050 and you are the planet CIA agent at NASA-D5 Saturn base station. Recently, you hacked into Kepler-416 alien system and have found out that D47 is going to envade planet earth soon and kill the planet president.
You hacked the watch of D47's watch and found that it synchronizes and get the time of any planet sent from Kepler-416. You dont know the current time of the earth. But you can follow D47. Your mission is to save planet president and maintain peace.
You got to know that D47 recieves a CRC where time is encoded with parity generator 1011. D47 will land at base station at India and take international flights upto America where president lives.
We know that he has to take the shortest possible path. To reach from one to another location it takes exactly 10 seconds and every two station, a single bit error has to occur with D47's watch at least significant bit due to time dilation. 
Now you have to report the exact time to city police so that they can capture the assassin and save the president.
