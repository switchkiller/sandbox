<!--Traversal in graphs-->

Applications of BFS:

1. Cycle detection in undirected graphs
2. Fordâ€“Fulkerson algorithm
3. To test if a graph is Bipartite
4. Finding all nodes within one connected component
5. Shortest Path and Minimum Spanning Tree for unweighted graph

Applications of DFS:

1. For an unweighted graph, DFS traversal of the graph produces the minimum spanning tree and all pair shortest path tree.
2. Detecting cycle in a graph
3. Path Finding
4. Topological Sorting
5. To test if a graph is bipartite
6. Finding Strongly Connected Components of a graph
7. Solving puzzles with only one solution
